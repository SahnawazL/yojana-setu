## 📖 About

**YojanaSetu** (योजना सेतु — *"Scheme Bridge"*) is an independent civic technology platform built to help citizens of India discover and access the government welfare schemes they are legally entitled to.

The platform eliminates the information gap between citizens and the government welfare ecosystem — regardless of location, language, or literacy level — through smart search, an AI-powered assistant, and a personalized eligibility checker.

> ⚠️ YojanaSetu is an independent platform and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of** any Central or State Government body or ministry.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Firebase project (Auth + Firestore enabled)
- A Groq API key
- A Vercel account (for deployment)
- An EmailJS account (for report email notifications)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SahnawazL/yojana-setu.git
cd yojana-setu

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

A `.env.example` file is included in the repo. Copy it and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key variables you need to set:

```env
# Groq API keys — YojanaSetu rotates across 5 keys to stay within free-tier limits
# Get yours from: https://console.groq.com
GROQ_API_KEY_1=your_groq_api_key_1
GROQ_API_KEY_2=your_groq_api_key_2
GROQ_API_KEY_3=your_groq_api_key_3
GROQ_API_KEY_4=your_groq_api_key_4
GROQ_API_KEY_5=your_groq_api_key_5

# Vercel KV / Redis — auto-populated when you add a KV database in Vercel dashboard
KV_URL=your_kv_url
KV_REST_API_URL=your_kv_rest_api_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_kv_rest_api_token
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=your_kv_rest_api_read_only_token
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
```

> ⚠️ All Groq and KV keys must be set as **Vercel environment variables** only — they are used server-side via `/api/chat` and never exposed in client-side code.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🔐 Authentication

YojanaSetu supports three sign-in methods:

- 📱 **Phone OTP** — via Firebase Phone Auth
- 🔵 **Google Sign-In** — via Firebase Google Provider
- 📧 **Email & Password** — via Firebase Email Auth

Signing in unlocks personalized scheme matching, profile-aware AI responses, report tracking, and email notifications.

---

## 🤖 AI Assistant — How It Works

The AI assistant uses **Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`** model via a secure Vercel serverless route (`/api/chat`). Key behaviours:

- Full conversation history is sent with each request for context continuity
- If the user has a saved profile, it is injected as a context prefix so the AI personalises every response without asking repeated questions
- A **reading-time cooldown** is applied after each AI reply (10–15 seconds based on reply length) to promote healthy reading pacing
- Follow-up suggestion chips are AI-generated and filtered to avoid repetition
- Chat history is persisted per user in `localStorage` (keyed by Firebase UID)

---

## 📬 Report System

Citizens can submit four types of reports directly from the app:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🐛 Bug / Issue Report | Technical issues or unexpected app behaviour |
| 📋 Scheme Addition Request | Request for a missing scheme to be added |
| ❓ General Query | Questions about any scheme or feature |
| 💡 Feedback & Suggestions | Suggestions to improve the platform |

Logged-in users receive **automatic email confirmation** on submission and are **notified by email** when the admin team responds.

---

## ⚖️ Legal & Disclaimer

- YojanaSetu is an **independent** digital platform and is not affiliated with any government body.
- All scheme data is sourced from publicly available official government portals.
- Users are advised to **verify scheme details directly from official government sources** before applying.
